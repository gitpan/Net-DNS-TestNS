Version 1.09 8 June 2005

   Fixed portability issue with Makefile.PL.

   backward portability). 

Version 1.08 public release, 3 June 2005

Version 1.07 

  Rewrite and extention addition of many features.

  The DTD for the configuration file has changed. Although this 
  module still reads the old configuration XML you are adviced to 
  change the XML by running 
    xsltproc transform-conf.xsl oldconf.xml > newconf.xml

  definition.

  (for xsltproc see the libxslt home page: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/ )
